Final Capstone Plugin

Summary:
This audio plugin was written using the JUCE framework. It compiles as a VST, VST3, and AU and can be used in any digital audio workstation that supports these plugin extensions. This plugin adds a distortion/delay effect to a channel of audio. There are several different distortion effects to choose from as well as a versatile delay section that allows you to change delay time, wet/dry signal strength, and the amount of feedback.
